<h3>whosonfirst-data versus whosonfirst-data-SOMETHING repositories [Repo naming conventions]</h3>
<p>There is a lot of data in Who's On First, more than can practically fit in a single GitHub repository. Someday it may be possible but today it is not. To account for this fact Who's On First data has been separated into a number of different GitHub repositories organized by placetype and region.</p>
<p>The naming conventions for repositories at their most granular is as follows:</p>
<pre>whosonfirst-data + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_PLACETYPE + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_COUNTRY + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_SUBDIVISION</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data">whosonfirst-data</a> — administrative data (continents - microhoods) for the world</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ca">whosonfirst-data-venue-us-ca</a> — venues in California, USA</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-venue-ca">whosonfirst-data-venue-ca</a> — venues in Canada</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode-fi">whosonfirst-data-postalcode-fi</a> — postalcodes in Finland</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to note is that not all repositories are as granular as the rules described above. Wherever feasible we try to bundle records with the least amount of granularity as possible. For example postalcodes are grouped by country as are venues unless there are so many of them, like in the USA, that it is not practical to keep them in a single parent repository.</p>
<p>If a repository grows so much [data] that it is no longer practical to keep everything in one place then it may be subdivided into a number of child repositories. Venues are a good example of this.</p>
<p>We try to maintain a separate parent repository for things that have been broken out into multiple child repositories. For example there is a <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode">whosonfirst-data-postalcode</a> repository that contains no data but instead <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode/blob/master/DATA.md">a pointer to all the repositories</a> that do have postalcode data. We also do the same for <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue-us">venues in the USA</a>. This practice is still in its early stages so we apologize in advance if it's bumpy or incomplete.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data">whosonfirst-data repository</a> is the obvious exception (or perfect example, depending on how you look at it) to the scenario described above. This repository contains all administrative placetypes (<a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-placetypes">all the places between and inclusive of continents to microhoods</a>) for the entire world. While it is possible to imagine that the sum total of all the neighbourhoods in the world will require putting them in a separate repository but we are going to hold off doing that for as long as we can.</p>
<p>Who's On First records should always have a wof:repo property indicating the repository to which they belong. If they don't that's a bug.</p>
