<h1 id="github">Github</h1>
<p>We haven’t quite figured out what the best way of both distributing the Who’s On First data and of accepting corrections or suggestions from community. Even though the nice people at GitHub continue to do excellent work at making Git easier for a broader population to use, the reality remains that Git is a significant barrier to participation for many people.</p>
<p>Absent a more formal decision about an alternative, GitHub at least allows us to point in the general direction of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An open and readily distributed dataset that people can download and work with.</li>
<li>A way for people to contribute corrections (and general nuance) about a place.</li>
<li>A way for us to be able to do everything above while still assuring us a measure of authority around the <li>assertions we make about the data.</li>
<li>Also a way for us to think about how and where we store an audit trail (of sorts) for updates to a place.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some very real problems working with Who's On First data in Git repositories, still, so it's possible that we will stop using entirely.</p>
