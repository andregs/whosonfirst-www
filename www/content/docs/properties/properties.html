<h2 id="minimum-viable-properties">Minimum Viable Properties</h2>
<p>The design model for the Flickr API was: What is the one thing you should always be able to do with any photo-related API response?</p>
<p>For Flickr the answer was the “standard photo response” or: You should always be able to load/build the URL for a photo with a link back to its page on Flickr’s website.</p>
<p>In Mapzen’s case the answer to a similar-minded question might be: You should always be able to view API responses on a map.</p>
<p>For example it should be possible to take anything that comes back from Pelias (or any other API) and simply hand it off to Leaflet as a GeoJSON layer and see something on a map.</p>
<p>With that in mind a “minimal viable properties” dictionary might look like this:
<pre>{
    "wof:id": 85922583,
    "wof:name": "San Francisco",
    "wof:fullname": "San Francisco, California US",
    "wof:placetype": "locality",
    "wof:parent_id": 85688637,
    "wof:quality": 9,
    "wof:score": 100
}
</pre>
<p>A couple things to note about this example:
<ul>
<li>When we say “properties” we’re talking about the metadata associated with that place rather than its geometry.</li>
<li>The wof:score property and its semantics should be considered a place-holder for some equivalent search ranking to be determined by the Pelias team. Likewise, the wof:quality property and its semantics should also be considered a place-holder for some equivalent quality/confidence ranking to be determined by the Data team.</li>
</ul>
