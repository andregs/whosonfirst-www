	  <h3 id="2017-ux">User experience, documentation and general sense-making</h3>
	  
	  <p>The <a href="https://www.mapzen.com/">Mapzen</a> data team is looking for an intern interested in user experience, usability, and the importance of good documentation. <span class="hey-look">If selected, you will work on improving how we present Who’s On First to the world.</span> Who’s On First (WOF) is our open data gazetteer (“a big list of places”) that we would like to make more accessible to a wider range of users.</p>

	  <p>The WOF project aims to provide convenient access to useful data about all the places in the world. At present we have around 26 million records, encoding data about places like cities, continents, parks, nation states, museums, bus stations, restaurants, music venues, congressional districts &#8212; <a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/placetypes/" class="hey-look">basically anything you might point to out in the physical world that exists at a location</a>.</p>

	  <p>To apply, send a brief (less than 500 words) introduction to <code>wof-interns @ mapzen.com</code> and describe some specific ideas you might want to pursue during the course of a 12-week internship. The start date is flexible. We will prefer proposals that have a realistic scope within the timeframe. <span class="hey-look">The purpose of the Mapzen data internship is for you to upgrade your skills and create something of lasting value.</span> You will work on a project you can finish before you leave, something tangible that other people can use.</p>

	  <p>You will work from our New York office in the Flatiron District on some regular schedule, alongside a team of creative map enthusiasts. You will work independently, but with guidance and assistance from Mapzen (mostly Dan and Stephen). <span class="hey-look">We’re eager to learn how we might adapt our approach by seeing our work through your fresh eyes.</span> The position is paid, commensurate with experience and background.</p>

	  <p>If you'd like to know more about the Who's On First project <a href="http://s.mlkshk-cdn.com/r/1BCLX">the long version</a> is over here: <a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/theory/" class="hey-look">https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/theory/</a></p>
