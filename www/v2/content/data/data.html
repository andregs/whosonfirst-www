<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Who’s On First is comprised of millions and millions of GeoJSON files. These files live in a Github organization called whosonfirst-data. The decision for this organization was spurred on by the work we’ve been doing to import venues and postal codes.</p>
<p>Work that has translated in to 24 million GeoJSON files spread across 488 GitHub repositories. Before we go any further, let’s be clear about one thing: This is not an ideal situation.</p>
<p>Ultimately our goal is to have a single monolithic Who’s On First repository that will contain all 24 million (and counting) records. In 2017 storing 24 million tiny files in a single Git repository is either technically impossible or so impractical as to “play impossible on TV”.</p>
