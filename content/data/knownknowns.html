<h1>There are known knowns...</h1> <h2>Some records have no geometry or a centroid of 0,0</h2> <p>Which the exception of <a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/1/">Null Island</a> these are records that need to be researched and updated. We use a default centroid of <code>0,0</code> to ensure as a way of tracking records that are still in need of editorial love and so that there is at least something to keep the more conversative GeoJSON parsers out there happy.</p> <h2>Some polygon records contain 'buffered point' geometry</h2> <p>Some records represent point data as polygon data, such as: <a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/101873779">https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/101873779</a>, these records can be distinguished from actual geometries using the tag <code>qs:type="buffered point"</code>.</p> <h2>See also</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns</a></li> </ul>
