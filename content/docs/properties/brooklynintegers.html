<h1 id="brooklyn-integers">Brooklyn Integers</h1> <p>Brooklyn Integers is an independently owned and operated integer-as-a-service provider. All integers are hand-crafted and guaranteed to be unique and hella-beautiful. For example: <em><a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/85688637">85688637</a></em>.</p> <p>Each Who's On First record is assigned a unique identifier (or <code>wof:id</code>), derived from Brooklyn Integers. Rather than running our own unique ID service, we hold hands with the Brooklyn Integers service.</p> <p><strong><a href="http://brooklynintegers.com/create/">Create your own Brooklyn Integer today</a>!</strong></p>
