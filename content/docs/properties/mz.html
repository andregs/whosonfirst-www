<h1 id="mz">mz</h1> <h2 id="hierarchy_label">hierarchy_label</h2> <p>Used when generating place labels in geocoding software, like <a href="https://github.com/pelias/pelias">Pelias</a>; this property defaults to True unless it is set to <code>0</code> manually. When Pelias decorates an address string, the <code>hierarchy_label</code> property is used to determine what is included in that address string. Examples below:</p> <p>If the record for Noe Valley had a <code>hierarchy_label</code> property equal to <code>1</code> (or was not specified), a returned address would look like the following:</p> <p><em>29th St, San Francisco, California, United States</em></p> <p>If the record for Noe Valley had a <code>hierarchy_label</code> property equal to <code>1</code>, a returned address would look like the following:</p> <p><em>29th St, Noe Valley, San Francisco, California, United States</em></p> <h2 id="hours">hours</h2> <p>A simplified encoding of a venue's hours of operation. This is not designed to capture every edge case or exception, just daily hours with open/close times. The value is encoded as a dictionary with three-letter day abbreviations (<code>sun</code>, <code>mon</code>, <code>tue</code>, <code>wed</code>, <code>thu</code>, <code>fri</code>, <code>sat</code>) as keys. Each day value is a dictionary with <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> keys, and values are composed of 24-hour format time like <code>09:30</code> or <code>16:45</code>.</p> <h4 id="example">Example:</h4> <pre><code>"mz:hours": { 	"mon": { 		"open": "07:30", 		"close": "19:00" 	}, 	"tue": { 		"open": "08:30", 		"close": "22:00" 	} } </code></pre> <h2 id="is_approximate">is_approximate</h2> <p>This means that the geometry for this record is approximate in nature and probably derived from one of its ancestors. Technically the geometry may be incorrect but the rule of thumb is that it is still less-incorrect than no geometry or "spanning the entire globe". An optional property, when not present should be interpreted as <code>-1</code> unknown.</p> <ul> <li><code>-1</code> is unknown, or TBD (needs the love and care of a human)</li> <li><code>0</code> is false</li> <li><code>1</code> is true</li> </ul> <h2 id="is_current">is_current</h2> <p>This is a "helper" property to wrap up / hide the semantics of whether something is "open" or "existing". For example, a venue that is no longer in operation or a country (like Yugoslavia) that has dissolved in to smaller nations.</p> <ul> <li><code>0</code> signifies a non-current record</li> <li><code>1</code> signifies a current record</li> <li><code>-1</code> signifies an inderminate state, someone needs to look at this record and decide</li> </ul> <p>Therefore, any record with a date in the <code>edtf:cessation</code> or <code>edtf:deprecated</code> fields <em>should</em> have a <code>mz:is_current</code> field value of <code>0</code>.</p> <h2 id="is_funky">is_funky</h2> <ul> <li><code>-1</code> is unknown, or TBD (needs the love and care of a human)</li> <li><code>0</code> is false</li> <li><code>1</code> is true</li> </ul> <h2 id="is_hard_boundary">is_hard_boundary</h2> <p>Things like historic districts or similar with fixed, undisputed boundaries.</p> <ul> <li><code>0</code> is false</li> <li><code>1</code> is true</li> </ul> <h2 id="is_landuse_aoi">is_landuse_aoi</h2> <p>This is used to signify an area of interest. Labelling is supressed if a value of '1' is given.</p> <ul> <li><code>0</code> is false</li> <li><code>1</code> is true</li> </ul> <h2 id="is_official">is_official</h2> <p>Is this considered "official" by someone or something you pay taxes to?</p> <ul> <li><code>0</code> is false</li> <li><code>1</code> is true</li> </ul> <h2 id="max_zoom">max_zoom</h2> <p>Float values (though in practice mosts are integer values) that match to web map zoom schema. Common range is 0.0 to 18.0, though they can be greater.</p> <h2 id="min_zoom">min_zoom</h2> <p>Float values (though in practice mosts are integer values) that match to web map zoom schema.
