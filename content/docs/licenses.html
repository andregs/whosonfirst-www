<h1 id="data-licenses">Data licenses</h1> <h2 id="acceptable-data-licenses">Acceptable data licenses</h2> <p>Who's On First is an "open" project. Because Who’s On First is liberally licensed open data, we must be selective about adding new data. We either need to find a new source that is open data with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC-0</a> license that allows commercial and derivative works or create new shapes based on local knowledge and by cross-referencing multiple sources. Ideally, this new source should be an improvement over what Who’s On First already knows about the place.</p> <p>Other data licenses are <strong>not</strong> acceptable for import, as such licenses do not allow Who's On First to openly redistribute the data.</p> <h2 id="licensing-whos-on-first">Licensing Who's On First</h2> <p>Crediting Who's On First is recommended and linking back to the License is required. For example:</p> <blockquote> <p>Data from Who's On First. <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data/blob/master/LICENSE.md">License</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Who's On First dataset is both original work and a modification of existing open data. Some of those open data projects do require attribution. We have listed all sources in the full <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license file</a>.</p> <p>Remember, some sources require attribution, some do not. Mapzen's original work, including the format and structure that allows Who's On First to operate, is made available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">Creative Commons Zero</a> designation, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mapzen/">a shout out</a> would be lovely.</p> <h2 id="see-also">See also:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/">https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/</a></li> <li><a href="https://transit.land/an-open-project/">https://transit.land/an-open-project/</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="a-description-of-creative-common-licenses">A description of Creative Common Licenses:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/</a></li> </ul>
