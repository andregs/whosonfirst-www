<h1 id="assigning-cessation-and-deprecated-dates">Assigning Cessation and Deprecated Dates</h1> <p>When updating a record in Who's On First that is no longer current, it is important to differentiate between cessation and deprecated dates. Each have a specific meaning and usage in Who's On First.</p> <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2> <h3 id="edtfcessation">edtf:cessation</h3> <p>An EDTF date string indicating when a place ceased to exist as a political entity or social construct in "popular" culture.</p> <h3 id="edtfdeprecated">edtf:deprecated</h3> <p>An EDTF date string indicating when a Who's On First record was officially deprecated, for example if the record references a place considered to be invalid.</p> <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2> <p>Let's say we're updating Who's On First neighbourhood records for San Francisco, CA. An existing neighbourhood record could have a geometry that includes areas that are not typically referred to as part of that neighbourhood or an incorrect <code>wof:placetype</code>. In those cases, an <code>edtf:deprecated</code> date should be added to the record, as the record was never correct to begin with.</p> <p>However, if Who's On First had a record for, say, the Barbary Coast neighbourhood, this record would need an <code>edtf:cessation</code> date. The difference with the Barary Coast record update is that the Barbary Coast at one point was a valid, known neighbourhood that ceased to exist in time. It was replaced by the neighbourhoods of Chinatown, North Beach, and Jackson Square.</p> <p>Just because Who's On First decides a record belongs at a different placetype or should have a different geometry, does not mean that the record ceased to exist; it was simply categorized incorrectly.</p> <p><strong>Remember</strong>: cessation dates have a specific meaning; it represents the date that a place ceased to exist or was replaced by something else. Deprecated dates should be used when it has been decided that a place was never represented correctly to begin with.</p> <h2 id="simply-put">Simply put...</h2> <p>The <code>edtf:deprecated</code> property should be used as a default when updating a record that is no longer current. Use the <code>edtf:cessation</code> property only if the record has a "hard" end date.</p> <h2 id="see-also">See also</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-dates">https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-dates</a></li> </ul>
