		<p class="whosonfirst-link-caption">As the world is in a state of constant change, Who's On First (WOF) records are constantly changing, too. With most record changes, a simple property update and update to the wof:lastmodified property field is sufficient. However, if a Significant Event takes place, additional work is needed.</p>

		<p class="whosonfirst-link-caption">The Who's On First (WOF) project is not pretending to be the authority of truth, but rather a home for data from various sources and a project that we hope generates discussion. The WOF gazetteer houses data for many geographies, including counties (which parent cities) and cities (which parent microhoods, neighbourhoods, and macrohoods). Neighbourhoods are the places where we live and work in cities; the more neighbourhood data, the better.</p>
